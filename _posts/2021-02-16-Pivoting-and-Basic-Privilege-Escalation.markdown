#### Third CTF from eLearnSecurity's PTS course.  
Blackbox szenario.  
[network pivoting, basic privilege escalation]
Connected to internal network via eth0.  

### Task: discover and exploit all machines on the network.

â‡’ Tools used: Nmap, Dirb, FTP Utility, Metasploit (MSFvenom, MSFpayload & Listener for reverse TCP shell)

- Network discovery
- Pivoting to other networks
- Basic privilege escalation


###### Stage I - Information Gathering:
lab environment, no OSINT applicable

###### Stage II - Footprinting and Scanning
Nmap

###### Stage III - Vulnerability Assessment
Nessus

###### Stage IV - Web Attacks
Dirb - Enumerating web resources

###### Stage V - System Attacks
Ncrack - Dictionary Attack - Brute Forcing SSH
